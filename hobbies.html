<h1> My Hobbies</h1>
<p>Hello, this is Caroline Pena! 
<br/>
Thank you for having taken an interest on learning more about me.
<br/>
Please find my list of hobbies below.
    <h2><u>Visual Arts</u></h2>
    <h3>3D Art</h3>
Being a very creative and imaginative person, I have a natural attratction for this domain of the arts.
I mostly enjoy creating fun 3D illustrations using Blender and have opened an Instagram page to post things on my free time.

    <h3>Painting & Drawing</h3>
<p>I used to take traditional art classes as a child but have since been self-learning some proper techniques during my free time.
    <br/>
    Please find some examples below:
</p>

    <tr>

        <td> <img src="images/Frog (2).jpg" height="300" alt="An acrylic painting of a frog in a pond"> </td>

        <td> <img src="images/Elvis.jpg" width="200" alt="a pencil drawing of an Elvis Presley portrait"></td>
    </tr>
</table>
    <h3>Music</h3>
<p>I took some beginner piano classes for 2 years (without having an instrument funnily enough), but ever since then I've been teaching myself piano (on and off).
    <br/>
    I've learnt songs such as the popular Fur Elise, Victor's Piano Piece from Corpse Bride and a bit of the Turkish March.
</p>
    <h3>Sports</h3>
    I love ice skating and plan on taking some figure skating classes soon!
